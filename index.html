      <h3>
        Find the dream home - save time
      </h3>

      <p>
        Virtual Reality is used more, and more in all different kinds of companies.
        The most common we know is gaming, where we put on the ‘’glasses’’ and can
        find our self in the game-world. But it is not just for games anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now it has come to Real Estate as well. Imagine helping people find the perfect
       home. It is full of light and it fits them 100%. You can now show people their
       dream house or apartment with Virtual Reality without taking them to the house
       or apartment. It saves you and the buyer a lot of time and gives the buyer a
       virtual experience of their new home, so let them put on those ‘’glasses’’
       and find them their perfect home with VR!
